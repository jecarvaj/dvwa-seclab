<h3> Laboratorio de Seguridad Informática </h3>
	<p>El laboratorio consta de  5 ejercicios, indicados en la barra lateral izquiera</p>
<p>
<br> <em>Ataque de Fuerza Bruta:</em> Obtener las cuentas y sus respectivas contraseñas usando hydra para realizar un ataque de fuerza bruta a un servidor</br>
 </p>
	<p>The aim of DVWA is to <em>practice some of the most common web vulnerability</em>, with <em>various difficultly levels</em>, with a simple straightforward interface.</p>
	<hr />
	<br />

	<h3>Instrucciones Generales</h3>
	<p>En la barra lateral izquiera encontrará la descripción de cada ataque y algunos tips.</p>
	<!--<p>Please note, there are <em>both documented and undocumented vulnerability</em> with this software. This is intentional. You are encouraged to try and discover as many issues as possible.</p>
	<p>DVWA also includes a Web Application Firewall (WAF), PHPIDS, which can be enabled at any stage to further increase the difficulty. This will demonstrate how adding another layer of security may block certain malicious actions. Note, there are also various public methods at bypassing these protections (so this can be see an as extension for more advance users)!</p>
	<p>There is a help button at the bottom of each page, which allows you to view hints & tips for that vulnerability. There are also additional links for further background reading, which relates to that security issue.</p>

	<h2>WARNING!</h2>
	<p>Damn Vulnerable Web Application is damn vulnerable! <em>Do not upload it to your hosting provider's public html folder or any Internet facing servers</em>, as they will be compromised. It is recommend using a virtual machine (such as " . dvwaExternalLinkUrlGet( 'https://www.virtualbox.org/','VirtualBox' ) . " or " . dvwaExternalLinkUrlGet( 'https://www.vmware.com/','VMware' ) . "), which is set to NAT networking mode. Inside a guest machine, you can downloading and install " . dvwaExternalLinkUrlGet( 'https://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html','XAMPP' ) . " for the web server and database.</p>
